    `<p>Who is Theron? A professional web developer, amateur game developer, adventurous cross-country traveler, and enthusastic fat cat lover.</p>

    <p>Client-side web design and development has always been my forté, but I have dipped my toes into some back-end development (mainly in Node.js). And I also love mobile development, and have experience building hybrid apps and native Android and iOS apps, with experience deploying to both respective app stores. </p>

    <p>Check out some of <a href="/#/projects">my work</a> for a sense of what I can do, and take a look at <a href="https://github.com/theronpatrick" target="_blank">my GitHub</a> for a sense of how I do it.</p>

    <p>I spent the summer of 2017 on a <a href="http://theronp.com/roadtrip" target="_blank">three month solo cross-country adventure</a>.`,
