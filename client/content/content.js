    `<p>My name's Theron, I'm a professional web developer, amateur game developer, and recreational fat cat lover.</p>

    <p>Front-end design and development has always been my forté, but I've dipped my toes into some back-end development (Node.js is my jam). Love all things mobile development (even Xcode), and have experience building hybrid apps and native Android and iOS apps, with experience deploying to both respective app stores. </p>

    <p>Check out some of <a href="/#/projects">my work</a> for a sense of what I can do, and take a look at <a href="https://github.com/theronpatrick" target="_blank">my GitHub</a> for a sense of how I do it.</p>

    <p>I'm currently open to web front-end or mobile client development contracts, so if you've got a fun and challenging project you need help building please <a href="/#/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>`,
